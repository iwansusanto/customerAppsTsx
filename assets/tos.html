Mshwar offers an ordering and delivery service from our Partner
Restaurants throughout Qatar. Each Partner Restaurant has a
prescribed delivery to ensure that their Meals reach your door when
they are at their best. If you live outside the delivery areas, a
message will appear on the screen notifying you that ordering online
will not be possible. We do not accept orders from individuals to an
area in which we do not have a Partner Restaurant. Operating hours
will vary depending on local trading conditions and the availability
of our Partner Restaurants. Please click on the relevant link to view
the menus on our Service, and then click on your chosen menu which
will provide you with the option to submit your order to your chosen
Partner Restaurant</p>

When you place an order through our Service, an email thanking you
for your order and confirming your order has been received and
accepted by the Partner Restaurant (the <b>&quot;Confirmation Email&quot;</b>)
will be sent to you by us on behalf of the Partner Restaurant. The
contract for the supply of any Meal you order through us will be
between you and the Partner Restaurant and will only be formed when
we have sent you the Confirmation Email. Please ensure that you have
given us a correct email address as this is how we will communicate
with you about your Order. Please also ensure that you provide an
accurate address and telephone number to ensure that your Meals
arrive at the correct location. If you do not open the door or
respond to telephonic correspondence within 10 minutes of our
delivery drivers physically reaching your address, we reserve the
right to leave the premises, and you will be charged for the Meal.
Mshwar seeks to provide a quality service and will be the first
contact in the event if there is a problem with your Meal either in
regards to food quality and/or temperature. We do monitor our Partner
Restaurants very closely, and it is of utmost importance to us that
they comply with our standards and help us to maintain our
reputation. Please let us know if you have any comments relating to
our Partner Restaurants or in respect of the Meals by emailing or
calling us.</p>

All Meals are subject to availability. Your Partner Restaurant may
offer an alternative for any Meal it cannot provide you with the

We aim to provide the best delivery service possible. Unfortunately,
things do not always go to plan and factors, such as traffic
conditions and weather, may occasionally prevent us from achieving
our targets in this regard. We will do our best to ensure that your
Meal is delivered by the time specified in the email and webpage. The
timing of your order is determined by taking into account the number
of orders and the circumstances being faced by the Partner Restaurant
at that time. The delivery time that is showing in the restaurants'
logo interface as AVG 50 min, for example, it means the average time,
it is not a fixed time for the delivery, it would be more or less
depends on restaurants and the roads conditions. On the other hand,
the expected delivery time is not fixed time it can be less or more
for 15 minutes.</p>

You have the right to cancel an order within a reasonable time and
before the order becomes a Started Order. A Partner Restaurant will
classify a wrong order as any order which is canceled after the food
has been used to start preparing the order (a <b>&quot;Started
Order&quot;</b>). Customers can cancel an order by contacting the
Partner Restaurant. Mshwar and the Partner Restaurant may cancel any
order and will tell you once we cancel an order and will tell you the
reason of cancellation. You will not be charged for any orders
canceled following this clause. Any payment made before an order
being canceled by Mshwar or a Partner Restaurant will usually be
reimbursed using the same method you used to pay for your order and
if the payment were not cashed, the refund would be within Seven
working days. Any order canceled after it becomes a Started Order
will be charged to you. Mshwar alone will determine whether an order
is a Started Order or not.</p>

The price of any Meals will be listed on our Service. Prices will
vary between menus. Prices are liable to change at any time, but
changes will not affect orders in respect of which you have been
presented with the Confirmation Email, save in the case of an obvious
pricing mistake, whereby we will notify you as soon as we can about
the pricing issue. You may be able to cancel your order once we
notify you. Despite our best efforts, some of the Meals listed on our
Service may be incorrectly priced. The relevant Partner Restaurant
will normally verify prices as part of the order process. Payment for
all Meals can be made by cash on delivery or credit or debit card
through our Service. Once your order has been confirmed your credit
or debit card will have been authorized and the amount marked for
payment. Payment is made directly to Mshwar and is subsequently
passed on by Mshwar to the Partner Restaurant. We are authorized by
our Partner Restaurants to accept payment on their behalf and payment
of the price of any Meals to us will discharge your obligations to
pay such price to the Partner Restaurant.</p>
